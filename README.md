This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hello, My name is Lucie. I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in Science and numerics for Health, specializing in Health Device Engineering, at the University of Montpellier.

This is a repository created to learn the basics of Git and GitHub through hands-on practice. This is my first time using Git and GitHub. GitHub is a platform that allows you to host and manage code, track changes, and collaborate easily with other developers. I want to learn how to use Git and GitHub to better organize my projects, keep track of code changes, and work efficiently as part of a team.
