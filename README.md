# MAM2ADMM-Series00-Git-LucieBonn
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hello, My name is Lucie. I am a second-year Master’s student in Science and numerics for Health, specializing in Health Device Engineering, at the University of Montpellier.

This is a repository created to learn the basics of Git and GitHub through hands-on practice. This is my first time using Git and GitHub. GitHub is a platform that allows you to host and manage code, track changes, and collaborate easily with other developers. I want to learn how to use Git and GitHub to better organize my projects, keep track of code changes, and work efficiently as part of a team.

This image shows two people hiking in the mountains. Hiking is a physical activity that benefits both physical and mental health. It helps improve cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength, while also allowing people to disconnect from daily stress and recharge in nature. This perfectly relates to my course on physical activity and health, which emphasizes the importance of exercise for overall well-being.

# My motivation to learn Python, R and Git

I am motivated to deepen my skills in R and Python, which I had the opportunity to develop during my master’s studies, particularly in biostatistics and data science. These tools allow me to analyze and interpret complex data, which is essential in the health field. I would like to connect these skills with this course on physical activity and health to better understand the impacts and benefits of exercise on public health. Additionally, learning to use Git and GitHub will help me organize my work, track my projects, and collaborate effectively with other students and colleagues. This combination of technical and scientific skills is a real strength for me to grow in this exciting field.
